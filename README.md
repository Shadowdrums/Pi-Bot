# ðŸ¤– Pi-Bot for Raspberry Pi 4

A versatile bot tailored for Raspberry Pi 4. This bot was designed and developed using Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi 4. It comes with a suite of programs catering to network analysis, sentiment-based learning, and basic digital forensics.

## ðŸ”§ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

#### Libraries Used:

- **`textblob`**: For sentiment analysis in `pi_learning.py`.
- **`psutil`**: This library provides an interface to fetch system details like network statistics, which is vital for `network_assist.py`.
- **`scapy`**: An invaluable tool for network analysis, `scapy` powers many features in `network_assist.py`, especially packet sniffing.
- **`speedtest-cli`**: Used in `network_assist.py` to measure the internet speed of the connected network.
- **`netifaces`**: Facilitates network interface interrogation, primarily used in `network_assist.py`.
- **`os`**: A built-in Python library used in `forensics_mode.py` for interacting with the operating system, especially for tasks related to file management.

#### Installation:

1. Ensure you're running this on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Kali Linux installed.
2. Move into the project directory:

cd path_to_your_directory

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install textblob psutil scapy speedtest-cli netifaces

4. Provide execute permissions:

chmod +x pi_learning.py network_assist.py forensics_mode.py

## ðŸ“š Modules

### 1. **`pi-chat` (Main Script)**:
The primary interaction point for users, `pi-chat` acts as the central hub binding the capabilities of all other modules, providing an intuitive and interactive experience.

### 2. **`pi_learning.py`**: 
This module uses sentiment analysis from the `textblob` library to analyze the sentiment of a given text. It can recognize and respond to greetings, farewells, weather queries, news-related queries, technical issues, and more. Moreover, it learns from user corrections and stores them for future interactions.

### 3. **`network_assist.py`**: 
A utility tool that assists in network-related tasks such as mapping the network topology, packet sniffing, scanning available Wi-Fi networks, checking SSH status, and more. Leveraging the power of `scapy`, `psutil`, and other libraries, this module is vital for those who want to analyze their network.

### 4. **`forensics_mode.py`**: 
This module provides basic digital forensics capabilities. It can recover potentially deleted files, analyze file metadata, and scan for specific file signatures in a given directory.

### 5. **`pi_calc`**:
This module serves as a handy calculator tool for various mathematical operations. Be it simple arithmetic or more complex computations, `pi_calc` facilitates on-the-go calculations.

### 6. **`pi_assistant`**:
A general-purpose assistant module, `pi_assistant` offers a range of utilities and functionalities to aid users in day-to-day tasks. From setting reminders and alarms to searching the web and more, `pi_assistant` stands as a multifaceted helper for Pi-Bot users.

## ðŸŒŸ Conclusion
